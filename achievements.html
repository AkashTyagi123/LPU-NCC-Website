                                    Hello aspirants, I am Anirudh Pattathil, and am here to share my ssb experience of my back to back recommendations. I got recommended from 3AFSB Gandhinagar for NDA 143 and 18 SSB Allahabad for TES 42. I attended my NDA interview as a fresher and the knowledge I knew about SSB were gained mainly from DefenceDirectEducation and a coaching institution in Coimbatore called Coimbatore Defence Academy. I believe they helped me prepare well for the SSB and gave me tips on how to clear it.<br>
                                    We were told to report at 6 pm on 19 Aug at Patikashram bustand in Gandhinagar. I was all exited and had even arrived a day in advance. Then we were all taken to the board and we were taken into the Hall to fill up a few mandatory forms. After that they took us out for some light breakfast and then started allotment of chest numbers. I was given 88 as it was according to date of birth and I was one of the oldest freshers there. Then we had our screening.<br>
                                    My advice Is that you try and be yourself, try and enjoy your 5 days, make tons of friends, create memorable experiences and you’ll just see the magical hand of God working.
                                    Jai Hind!

My SSB success story might be a bit long , So I request your some time. To start, since childhood I too had a dream to join DEFENCE FORCES as an Officer. So I started preparing for NDA right from class 11. I gave my first attempt in Sep 2017, Cleared the exam and went for my first SSB at 1 AFSB- Dehradun….<br>

                                          And got conferenced out. With heavy heart I again appeared for NDA written in April 2018  cleared it and this time I had OVERCONFIDENCE that this time I will get screen in easily. I watched a lot of youtube videos about SSB. But unfortunately got screened out from

                                          2 AFSB,Mysore. It was very disheartening for me as well as for my parents. My father who himself is a Captain in Indian Army. I got a bit emotional. I took a year drop to prepare for NDA and JEE-Mains .<br>

                                          I went to Kota like many others to prepare for JEE-Mains. Till this time I had filled form for TES twice but did not got call for SSB as I did not cleared the cut off.<br>

                            <div class="heros-story" style="display: none;">
                                Hey defence aspirants out there.my name is leroy fernandes and i got recommended in my first attempt from 34 ssb allahabad (the so called rejection center),in my very first attempt. So let me give you gentlemen and women some insight into where my journey began.it all started , when i was in my class 9th standard, i was young and motivated to join the forces. I was an obese and chubby kid and a very average student in my class. When i got to know about the fitness standards of the army, i began running and over the next three years began gymming as well.i developed interest in physical fitness not considering my academics. I did lose weight and not only that, i became a marathon runner and also developed a good physique.it did give me a good feeling and also gave me a kickstart to my long journey. Not paying much attention to my academics, i couldn’t clear my nda in my class 12th and hence it came as a shock to me. Slowly i began to realize that in order to become an officer i need to work on my olq’s. I worked on my time management and also started becoming more organized and finally cleared my nda written in the second attempt.<br>
                                Gentlemen, at last i would say don’t give up on your dreams, don’t listen to anyone about the procedure, be yourself, be confident and be calm, you’ll sail through the rough seas, i assure you. And for my repeater friends, please don’t give up, you’ll be there right in front of the flag someday! just don’t lose hope! Jai Hind!

                                  Hello, my name is Yatharth and I got recommended for IMA – 148th course from SSC Bhopal on 9th September 2019. I have been declared medically fit from SMB Bhopal and right now waiting for the merit list.

                                  I am unable to exactly recapitulate when did I conceive the dream of becoming an Army officer yet I believe it might have started with seeing someone in the uniform with stars on the shoulder. None can deny having gotten attracted to the uniform of an officer.<br>
                                  I filled for UPSC CDS -1 exam in end of year 2018 and carried on my preparations according to the exam schedule. I prepared English from Arihant’s and Plinth to paramount, Maths from Arihant’s and Quantum CAT, G.S from books written by Authors like M. laxmikant and Mazid Hussain. Studying from UPSC CSE level books proved immensely helpful to me in cracking the exam.

I would suggest aspirants to regularly read Oxford Dictionary and Norman Lewis along with English newspapers to improve their vocabulary as well.

After declaration of results in April 2019, I found myself to have been qualified for IMA and OTA interviews.

I subsequently started collecting information about the SSB interview and types of tests I would have to go through during it. At that time websites like Defence Direct Education (DDE) proved to be of benefit and provided me with all the theoretical information I needed about the interview processes. By that time I had a good idea about all the test and procedures. I kept on working on my English and reasoning skills as well.

Later on I came in contact with Colonel Ramesh Narayanan on account of our common interest in fountain pens, who displayed great confidence in my personality and motivated me towards the goal of becoming an officer. He guided me to be in contact of his good friend Colonel Ashokan Sir and such is luck that he turned out to be the director of Olive greens academy.

                                    Hello, friends, my name is Mohit Singh Nayal. I got recommended in my 12th attempt from 34 SSB Allahabad on 15th April 2019 and I believe my story will definitely motivate and help aspirants in achieving their goal.<br>

I will divide my story into two parts –<br>

1) Journey till now<br>

2) My findings and tips regarding SSB testings.<br>My Journey – Being from a defence background I always wanted to become an officer in armed forces. I gave my first SSB attempt in Nov, 2013 and within next four months, I had already given four attempts. Two for TES ARMY & two for TES NAVY. I was conferenced out in all of them. In my 1st SSB (ARMY) I was so unprepared and unaware that I couldn’t speak a word in both the group discussion of GTO. I couldn’t complete all my stories and was able to write only 40 sentences in WAT. I wasn’t able to answer any personal or general knowledge questions. Then I took coaching from Balnoi academy and now I realise how big that mistake was. I started mugging up stories, memorize interview answers and tried to project as if I am perfect in all aspects of life. I still remember the exams and practicals I had missed during my college days to attend SSB.<br>
During 4th year of my B.Tech I again started preparing for the AFCAT and other entries. But to my surprise, I got screened out in three consecutive attempts. I started questioning myself, have I degraded to a level that now I couldn’t clear even screen-in which once was a cake walk for me. Finally I got screened-in in June, 2017 AFCAT attempt but the final result didn’t change. That was the time when I introspected myself and decided to first understand SSB and what is actually required from a candidate. I started reading books, followed many YouTube SSB channels and finally attended a 2 day workshop of a psychologist. I contacted the psychologist and took 5-6 days personal guidance. His guidance gave me the direction and I realised the importance of general knowledge in life.<br>

Then I got placed in TCS from college placement. I decided to dedicate 2 months before my joining, preparing for SSB. I used to live with my brother in a 1 BHK flat in Dwarka Sec 23b. My brother used to come late at night and I used to cook food for both of us. In those days, I realised the power of loneliness. When your circle gets smaller your vision gets larger. As the saying goes “Nothing comes easy in life”, my AFCAT result was not out because of some mistakes I made during filling my OMR sheet. I was disheartened because I worked really hard and I was aware of the fact that once I joined TCS preparing for any exam would become a nightmare.

                                <b>In Conversation With Mehak Dhawan, Recommended From 33 SSB</b>

                                We had a conversation with Mehak Dhawan who recently got recommended from 33 SSB Bhopal and would be joining Indian Naval Academy soon. We discussed about her preparation, her stay at ssb centre and views on various aspects. We hope this artice will help every aspirant who is preparing to join the Armed Forces.

                                DDE: Congratulations on your recommendation. How does it feel now?

                                Mehak: Thank you. I feel immensely excited, nervous, happy and worried all at once. I’m excited that I will finally be living the dream I’ve dreamt for so long. I’m nervous and worried about the rigorous training I am about to face but I guess I’ll get that strength automatically when I’m there so these feelings can be shunned for now. And ofcourse, I’m happy because this is the best thing that has ever happened to me!

                                DDE: What motivated you to join Indian Navy?

                                Mehak: Being a Naval NCC Cadet, I have interacted with many Naval officers during the camps I have attended. Everything about these officers, from their gait to their way of speaking to the uniform and the command has inspired me to choose this as a way of life. Moreover, the disciplined and active environment of the camps made me discover new horizons about myself and motivated me to become an officer.

                                DDE: How did you plan and implemented your preparations for SSB?

                                Mehak: I used to practice WATs from YouTube videos and after writing all the 60 WATs, I would go throught the sentences I had written to see if I could have made better sentences. The same approach I used for TAT and SRT, too. My preparation was basically based on self analysis and improvement. I only practiced a few times, given the placement drives, projects and exams in final year, but even this little practice I did, took me a long way during the test. I was able to complete all WATs, write stories which were self satisfactory and did a good 45-50 SRTs. I also filled the PIQ form beforehand at least 3-4 times and went through it again and again to edit and improve it.

                                DDE: What were your plans to tackle GTO tasks. Which task was most interesting according to you and why?

                                Mehak: I did no preparation for GTO. I wanted to go there and let my natural instincts do the work. During the tasks, I tried to grasp every instruction given and implement it. I didn’t try to portray myself as a hero, trying to help everyone and shouting frantically, I just had my most natural demeanour on. The most interesting task according to me was the GPE. I never thought I could remember so much information given in one go and actually propose a solution about it. The most fun task was obviously the Group Race, which had us all sweating and pumped up shouting our warcry and running with the huge snake over our heads.

                                DDE: Can you share some light moments which you had encountered during your stay at SSB centre?

                                Mehak: One of my roommates was from Andhra Pradesh, the rest of us being north indians. So we were fascinated all the time with the way she used to speak hindi, with such innocence. She also taught us a few words and counting numbers while we sang Punjabi songs to entertain her.

                                DDE: What was going through your mind on conference day. How did you feel after your conference?

                                Mehak: Honestly, it was my first SSB and I made a call to my mother the previous day to not expect any good news from my side because I didn’t think my performance was upto the mark. I made a few mistakes in my interview and wanted to do better. So I had unloaded all this baggage by making this call home and was not expecting anything on the Conferene day. I was relaxed and was enjoying talking to the new friends I had made. After the conference, I was feeling even more confident about not having made through because they had only asked me about the places I visited in Bhopal and the food ate at the SSC Centre. I was sure that I will not be recommended because they didn’t ask me “important” questions, a misconception in my head which I later got rid of.

                                DDE: What was your reaction when the officer called your chest number?

                                Mehak: Before the results were announced, we were asked to stand up and spell out our names if our chest number was announced and walk out of the room. I was not anticipating to hear my chest number so I was busy looking towards the girls I thought would get recommended and admiring them. Mine was the second chest number they called out and I froze. My neighbour nudged me to get up as it was my number they were calling out, Chest number 17! I stood up, took a moment to absorb this feeling and spelled my name with so many pauses that it felt like I had been asked to spell an italian word in a spelling bee. It was an overwhelming moment, walking out of that room after spelling out my name and it will forever be one of the most unexpected and happy moments of my life.

                                DDE: What is your daily routine now?

                                Mehak: Now that college is done with and I’ll be joining the academy in a few days, most of my days are spent meeting old friends and relatives and spending time with my family before I leave. Amidst all this, I try to exercise daily as I am really nervous about the training, and I try to read as many of my books as possible before I leave them behind at home.

                                DDE: Any message to Aspirants?

                                Mehak: My message to the aspirants would be to not go to face the SSB with preconceived notions about it. Read any information you get about the SSB but go there with a clean slate in your head. This is helpful because it will help you in bringing out your most natural self during the tests and tasks, which I believe is the most important aspect in the SSB. Also, don’t get disheartened if you make mistakes in a task during the SSB. Make a mistake and forget it, so that the task that went wrong on day 2 of the SSB does not become the reason for making another mistake on day 3. Enjoy each and every task during the SSB and don’t try to pull others down during group discussions and tasks. Instead, try to be a group player, support others’ ideas and help them. If needed, do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not make you smaller or weaker, it only shows that you are accepting in nature. Never give on your dreams, they do come true if you keep working towards them.

                                  In Conversation With Kritin Sahota, Recommended For Indian Army (TGC – 129)

We had a chance to have few words with Kritin who recently got recommended from 31 SSB kapurthala in 5th attempt. He got screened out four times but his perseverance and dedication brought laurels to him and his family. We hope this conversation will help and motivate other aspirants to achieve their goals.

DDE: How does it feel to get recommended for Indian Army?

Kritin: The best feeling ever that cannot be measured. Cloud Nine moment.

DDE: What motivated you to join Indian Army?

Kritin: The motivation comes from my father and other relatives who are in the services who motivated me to join the Indian Army.

DDE: Aspirants often believe that technical entries are tough to crack. What are your thoughts on this.

Kritin: Not at all! Infact technical entries are like normal SSBs but for candidates with Btech/B.E degree. It would be helpful to brush up the basics of your stream and rest its just like any other SSB process.

DDE: Candidates believe that the screening process is little tough in Kapurthala. What would you like to say?

Kritin: Screening process is the same as any other SSB. It becomes difficult because many candidates report at one date.I was screened out four times from Kapurthala but got recommended the fifth time I went to Kapurthala.

DDE: How was your Personal Interview? Can you share your experience?

Kritin: My personal interview was very good. Mostly, in my interview I was asked about myself, my friends, family, news, and my hobbies-interests, some basic technical questions etc.

DDE: Did you take any coaching? What are your views on coaching?

Kritin: No. I feel in this competent world taking coaching is not bad at all but I have seen candidates in my attempts giving coached answers, dominating in GTO tasks which lead them to not getting recommended. So take coaching if you want for getting a feel of SSB but when you are at the SSB be yourself and be original in your answers.

DDE: Being an engineer what made you choose Army over IT jobs?

Kritin: There are some jobs which cannot be compared with monetary benefits. Want a fat pay cheque then corporate company is the answer. Want a disciplined and an adventurous life choose the Indian Army. That’s why I chose the latter.

DDE: How was this SSB different from your earlier attempts?

Kritin: This time I was more relaxed and mentally prepared to give my SSB.Also I had a backup plan. This made me focus on giving my best at my present because my future was already secure. I gave my best at every task with high josh, not worrying at all about the result.

DDE: Since you would be joining academy soon, what is your daily routine now?

Kritin: Daily routine includes getting up early in the morning going for a run/cycling ,come back, freshen up ,have breakfast and watch some news .After that I read the newspaper to gain knowledge about the latest events happening around me and the world. Have lunch and spend time listening to music and watching motivational movies. In the evening again, I go for a small run or go cycling with my friends. Then I come back, freshen up, and spend time with my family till dinner. Go to bed satisfied.

DDE: What would be your message to other aspirants?

Kritin: My message to other aspirants would be to be mentally prepared in clearing the SSB process. Focus on your preparation because that is in your hands the result is not. Lastly have a good backup option as in military there is always plan A,B,C . Don’t lose hope! Good luck and keep the josh high.

                                    Harpreet Singh, AIR-1 NCC OTA Chennai, Indian Army.

                                    Greetings everyone, I'm Harpreet Singh from Mohali and i've cleared SSB for OTA in my first attempt. I think it's not possible to message every single person out there so i thought of sharing my story through this famed page @defencedirecteducation .

                                    So it started from 10th when i joined AFPI to get into Defence forces but eventually i could not go to NDA and that resulted in me planning for getting into army after graduation. I joined NCC also and attended many renowned camps such as RDC 2015, IMA camp 2015 and many more.

                                    Talking about the SSB, i would recommend all of you to prepare for each tests seperately. For Stage 1 Testing, i'd recommend RS Aggarwal for intelligence test and make good logical and detailed story for PPDT. For psychological tests, the basic idea remains the same i.e. To be positive and stick to the stimulus shown to you. Never try to show your qualities by being dominant. Talking about the GTO, being humble and helping in nature is the key and in interview, stay calm and honest as much as possible. They may provoke you many times but that's what they're testing you for.

                                    This all may only help if you're truly determined to join the forces. I've been working for it from a long time and it's not a midnight success so STAY FOCUSED.
